# Authentication Security Audit

## Overview

This document details the security audit performed on the authentication functionality of ALX-Polly. The audit covers login, registration, session management, and related security controls.

## Components Audited

- `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`
- `app/lib/utils/validation.ts`
- `app/lib/utils/security.ts`
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`
- `app/lib/context/auth-context.tsx`

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Missing CSRF Protection in Authentication Forms

**Severity**: High

**Description**: The login and registration forms lacked CSRF tokens, making them vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Impact**: Attackers could potentially trick users into submitting authentication requests from malicious sites.

**Fix Implemented**: Added CSRF token generation, storage, and validation for all authentication forms.

```typescript
// CSRF token generation
useEffect(() => {
  const token = generateCSRFToken();
  setCsrfToken(token);
  sessionStorage.setItem("authCsrfToken", token);
}, []);

// CSRF token validation
const submittedToken = formData.get("csrfToken") as string;
const storedToken = sessionStorage.getItem("authCsrfToken") || "";
      
if (!validateCSRFToken(submittedToken, storedToken)) {
  setError("Security verification failed");
  return;
}
```

### 2. Insufficient Rate Limiting

**Severity**: Medium

**Description**: Rate limiting was implemented but not properly enforced on the client side, allowing rapid-fire submission attempts.

**Impact**: Vulnerability to brute force attacks through automated tools that could bypass client UI.

**Fix Implemented**: Enhanced rate limiting with proper client-side controls and improved server-side implementation:

```typescript
// Server-side rate limiting
export async function isRateLimited(identifier: string): Promise<{ limited: boolean; remainingAttempts: number }> {
  const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5;
  const WINDOW_MS = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
  // Implementation
}

// Client-side prevention of multiple submissions
if (loading) return;
setLoading(true);
```

### 3. Improper Error Handling

**Severity**: Medium

**Description**: Authentication errors were displayed with too much detail, potentially exposing internal system information.

**Impact**: Information disclosure that could aid attackers in understanding the authentication system.

**Fix Implemented**: Implemented generic error messages for users while maintaining detailed logging for administrators:

```typescript
// Generic user-facing error
setError("Invalid credentials. Please try again.");

// Detailed server-side logging
await logSecurityEvent('login_failed', false, { 
  email: data.email, 
  details: `Authentication error: ${error.message}` 
});
```

### 4. Lack of Input Sanitization

**Severity**: High

**Description**: User inputs for email and password were not properly sanitized before processing.

**Impact**: Potential for XSS attacks if authentication data was displayed elsewhere in the application.

**Fix Implemented**: Added input sanitization for all authentication fields:

```typescript
// Email sanitization
const sanitizedEmail = sanitizeText(email.toLowerCase());

// Validation with sanitized inputs
const validation = validateLoginForm({
  email: sanitizedEmail,
  password: password
});
```

### 5. Insecure Session Management

**Severity**: Critical

**Description**: Session tokens were not properly validated or rotated, creating potential for session hijacking.

**Impact**: Attackers could potentially use stolen session tokens indefinitely.

**Fix Implemented**: Enhanced session management with token validation and rotation:

```typescript
// Session validation on sensitive operations
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
if (!session) {
  throw new Error("Unauthorized");
}

// Session rotation after security-sensitive events
await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
```

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add an additional layer of security for sensitive operations or high-privilege accounts.

2. **Password Strength Requirements**: Enhance password requirements to enforce stronger passwords (currently only has minimum length).

3. **Account Lockout Notifications**: Implement email notifications when accounts are locked due to too many failed attempts.

4. **Regular Session Token Rotation**: Implement automatic session token rotation after a defined period of time.

5. **Security Headers**: Add security headers specifically for authentication pages to prevent clickjacking and other attacks.

## Conclusion

The authentication system has been significantly hardened against common web vulnerabilities. The implemented fixes address the most critical security issues, particularly CSRF protection and input sanitization. Continued monitoring and regular security audits are recommended to maintain a strong security posture.
