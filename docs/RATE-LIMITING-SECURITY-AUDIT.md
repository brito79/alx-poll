# Rate Limiting Security Audit

## Overview

This document outlines the audit of rate limiting mechanisms in the ALX-Polly application. Rate limiting is a critical security control that helps prevent abuse, brute force attacks, and denial of service attempts by restricting the frequency of actions a user can perform.

## Audit Scope

- Authentication rate limiting
- Action-based rate limiting (poll creation, voting, etc.)
- Implementation effectiveness
- Bypass vulnerabilities
- User experience considerations

## Key Findings

### 1. Authentication Rate Limiting

| Severity | Issue | Recommendation | Status |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 🔴 High | No rate limiting on login attempts | Implement progressive rate limiting | ✅ Fixed |
| 🔴 High | No rate limiting on registration | Add creation limits | ✅ Fixed |
| 🟠 Medium | No rate limiting on password reset | Add request frequency limits | ✅ Fixed |

### 2. Action-based Rate Limiting

| Severity | Issue | Recommendation | Status |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 🟠 Medium | No poll creation rate limiting | Implement per-user creation limits | ✅ Fixed |
| 🟠 Medium | No voting rate limiting | Add limits to prevent poll manipulation | ✅ Fixed |
| 🟠 Medium | No API request rate limiting | Implement global and endpoint-specific limits | ⏳ In Progress |

### 3. Implementation Issues

| Severity | Issue | Recommendation | Status |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 🔴 High | In-memory rate limiting store (not distributed) | Move to Redis or similar distributed store | ⏳ In Progress |
| 🟠 Medium | Non-async rate limiting functions | Convert to async for server components | ✅ Fixed |
| 🟡 Low | Fixed rate limits not configurable | Make limits configurable per environment | ⏳ In Progress |

### 4. Bypass Vulnerabilities

| Severity | Issue | Recommendation | Status |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 🔴 High | User-only rate limiting (no IP-based limits) | Implement combined user+IP rate limiting | ⏳ In Progress |
| 🟠 Medium | No UI controls to prevent rapid submissions | Add client-side throttling | ✅ Fixed |
| 🟠 Medium | Rate limit counters not reset on errors | Only count successful attempts in some cases | ✅ Fixed |

## Detailed Findings & Solutions

### Authentication Rate Limiting (🔴 High Risk)

**Issue:** Login attempts were not rate-limited, allowing brute force attacks.

**Solution:** Implemented progressive rate limiting with a sliding window:

```typescript
export async function isRateLimited(identifier: string): Promise<{ limited: boolean; remainingAttempts: number }> {
  const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5;
  const WINDOW_MS = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes
  const now = new Date();
  
  // Get existing attempts or initialize
  const attempts = loginAttempts.get(identifier) || { count: 0, firstAttempt: now };
  
  // Check if window has expired and reset if needed
  if ((now.getTime() - attempts.firstAttempt.getTime()) > WINDOW_MS) {
    loginAttempts.set(identifier, { count: 1, firstAttempt: now });
    return { limited: false, remainingAttempts: MAX_ATTEMPTS - 1 };
  }
  
  // Increment attempt count
  attempts.count += 1;
  loginAttempts.set(identifier, attempts);
  
  // Check if exceeded
  const limited = attempts.count > MAX_ATTEMPTS;
  const remainingAttempts = Math.max(0, MAX_ATTEMPTS - attempts.count);
  
  return { limited, remainingAttempts };
}
```

### Action-based Rate Limiting (🟠 Medium Risk)

**Issue:** Users could create polls, vote, or perform other actions without frequency limits.

**Solution:** Implemented action-specific rate limiting:

```typescript
export async function checkPollActionRateLimit(userId: string, action: string): Promise<boolean> {
  let limit: number;
  
  // Set limits for different actions
  switch (action) {
    case 'createPoll':
      limit = 10; // 10 polls per hour
      break;
    case 'votePoll':
      limit = 30; // 30 votes per hour
      break;
    case 'deletePoll':
      limit = 15; // 15 deletes per hour
      break;
    default:
      limit = 60; // Default limit for other actions
  }
  
  const result = await checkRateLimit(`user_${userId}`, action, limit);
  return result.allowed;
}
```

### Non-Async Rate Limiting Functions (🟠 Medium Risk)

**Issue:** Rate limiting functions were synchronous but used in server components requiring async functions.

**Solution:** Converted rate limiting functions to async:

```typescript
// BEFORE
export function checkRateLimit(...): { allowed: boolean; resetTime: Date; remaining: number } {
  // Implementation
}

// AFTER
export async function checkRateLimit(...): Promise<{ allowed: boolean; resetTime: Date; remaining: number }> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### In-Memory Rate Limiting Store (🔴 High Risk)

**Issue:** Rate limiting used an in-memory store, which doesn't work in distributed environments and resets on app restart.

**Solution:** Added a note for future implementation of a distributed store:

```typescript
// Simple in-memory rate limiting store
// TODO: In production, use Redis or similar distributed store
const rateLimitStore: {
  [key: string]: { count: number; resetTime: number }
} = {};
```

### UI Controls for Rate Limiting (🟠 Medium Risk)

**Issue:** No UI controls prevented multiple rapid submissions that could bypass server-side rate limiting.

**Solution:** Added loading states and disabled controls:

```typescript
const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);

const handleSubmit = async (formData: FormData) => {
  if (loading) return;
  setLoading(true);
  
  try {
    const res = await createPoll(formData);
    if (res?.error) {
      setError(res.error);
    } else {
      setSuccess(true);
    }
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};

// Disabled button during submission
<Button type="submit" disabled={loading}>
  {loading ? "Creating..." : "Create Poll"}
</Button>
```

## Current Rate Limit Configuration

| Action | Limit | Time Window | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Login | 5 attempts | 15 minutes | Per email address |
| Registration | 3 attempts | 30 minutes | Per IP address |
| Poll Creation | 10 polls | 60 minutes | Per user |
| Poll Voting | 30 votes | 60 minutes | Per user |
| Poll Deletion | 15 deletions | 60 minutes | Per user |

## Recommended Future Improvements

1. **Distributed Rate Limiting Store**: Replace in-memory store with Redis or similar distributed solution.

2. **IP + User Combined Limiting**: Implement both IP-based and user-based limiting for better protection.

3. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Adjust limits based on user behavior patterns and risk factors.

4. **Configurable Limits**: Make rate limits configurable per environment without code changes.

5. **Rate Limiting Headers**: Add standard rate limit headers to API responses.

6. **Granular Tiered Limiting**: Implement multiple tiers of rate limiting (per second, minute, hour, day).

## Conclusion

The rate limiting audit revealed several critical gaps in the application's defenses against abuse and denial of service. The implementation of user-based rate limiting for authentication and key actions has significantly improved security, though several important enhancements remain to be implemented.

The most urgent remaining issue is the in-memory storage of rate limiting data, which should be replaced with a distributed solution before scaling beyond a single server instance.
