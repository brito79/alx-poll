# ALX-Polly Authentication Development Guidelines

## Authentication Architecture Rules

This document outlines the core principles, architectural guidelines, and implementation standards for the ALX-Polly authentication system. All authentication-related development must adhere to these rules to ensure security, scalability, and maintainability.

## 1. Folder Structure and Organization

### 1.1 Directory Organization
- All authentication pages must be located in `/app/(auth)/`
- Authentication components must be placed in `/app/(auth)/components/`
- Authentication logic must be organized in `/lib/auth/` with clear subdirectories:
  - `/actions/` - Server actions and API endpoints
  - `/hooks/` - React hooks for client-side auth
  - `/utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
  - `/types/` - Type definitions
  - `/context/` - Auth context providers

### 1.2 File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for component files: `password-reset-form.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utility functions: `tokenValidation.ts`
- Name files according to their primary function: `useAuthSession.ts`

## 2. Authentication Logic Implementation

### 2.1 Core Functions
All authentication functions must:
- Accept structured input parameters using object destructuring
- Return consistent response types with proper error handling
- Include proper TypeScript type definitions
- Implement appropriate logging

### 2.2 Required Authentication Functions
The system must implement these core functions:
- `signIn({ email, password, rememberMe }): Promise<AuthResult>`
- `signUp({ email, password, userData }): Promise<AuthResult>`
- `signOut({ everywhere, redirectTo }): Promise<void>`
- `resetPassword({ email }): Promise<ResetResult>`
- `verifyResetToken({ token, newPassword }): Promise<VerificationResult>`
- `validateSession(token): Promise<SessionValidationResult>`
- `refreshSession(): Promise<SessionResult>`

### 2.3 State Management
- Use React Context for global auth state
- Implement custom hooks for auth operations
- Support persistent sessions across page reloads
- Handle token refresh automatically

## 3. Security Requirements

### 3.1 Authentication Storage
- **MUST** use HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- **MUST NOT** store sensitive auth data in localStorage
- **MUST** implement proper CSRF protection
- **SHOULD** implement token rotation for long-lived sessions

### 3.2 Password Security
- **MUST** enforce minimum password complexity:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least 1 uppercase letter
  - At least 1 lowercase letter
  - At least 1 number
  - At least 1 special character
- **MUST** support password reset flow
- **SHOULD** implement password strength indicators
- **SHOULD** prevent use of commonly used passwords

### 3.3 Rate Limiting and Protection
- **MUST** implement rate limiting on all auth endpoints
- **MUST** implement account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- **MUST** provide security notifications for suspicious activities
- **SHOULD** implement IP-based anomaly detection

## 4. User Experience Guidelines

### 4.1 Form Design
- All auth forms must include:
  - Clear validation feedback
  - Accessible error messages
  - Loading states
  - Proper tab navigation
- Forms must be responsive and mobile-friendly

### 4.2 Authentication Flow
- Implement clear step-by-step flows for complex operations
- Provide feedback for all operations
- Support return to previous steps
- Include progress indicators for multi-step processes

### 4.3 Error Handling
- **MUST** provide user-friendly error messages
- **MUST** map backend errors to appropriate UI messages
- **MUST NOT** expose sensitive information in error messages
- **SHOULD** suggest resolution steps where appropriate

## 5. Code Quality Standards

### 5.1 Testing Requirements
- **MUST** implement unit tests for all auth functions
- **SHOULD** implement integration tests for auth flows
- **SHOULD** implement end-to-end tests for critical paths
- **MUST** test both success and failure scenarios

### 5.2 Documentation
- All exported functions must include JSDoc comments
- Complex authentication logic must include detailed comments
- Authentication architecture must be documented with diagrams

### 5.3 Performance Considerations
- Auth operations should complete within 2 seconds
- Implement loading states for operations exceeding 500ms
- Lazy-load non-critical authentication components
- Optimize bundle size for auth pages

## 6. Integration Guidelines

### 6.1 Supabase Integration
- Use server-side Supabase client for secure operations
- Use client-side Supabase client only when necessary
- Implement proper error handling for Supabase responses
- Follow Supabase best practices for auth operations

### 6.2 API Standards
- Use consistent error response formats
- Implement proper status codes
- Document all authentication endpoints
- Version API endpoints appropriately

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 7.1 Logging Requirements
- **MUST** log authentication attempts (success/failure)
- **MUST** log password resets and account changes
- **MUST NOT** log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- **SHOULD** implement structured logging for easier analysis

### 7.2 Analytics
- Track authentication success rates
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Analyze common failure points
- Measure authentication flow completion rates

## 8. Implementation Checklist

For each authentication feature, ensure:

1. ☐ Security requirements are met
2. ☐ Proper error handling is implemented
3. ☐ User feedback is clear and accessible
4. ☐ Types are properly defined
5. ☐ Tests cover success and failure cases
6. ☐ Documentation is complete
7. ☐ Performance is optimized
8. ☐ Code is reviewed for security issues

## 9. Future Considerations

- Support for multi-factor authentication
- Social login integration
- Biometric authentication support
- Enterprise SSO options
